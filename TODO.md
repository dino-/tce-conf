- SimpleConf: Would be great to use QuickCheck for testing instead
  of the two lonely HUnit tests we have now.
- Hackage generates a warning about the Haddock docs. They are
  using Haddock 2. Try this out and fix the problem.
- ReadConf: Can we support multiline {- -} style comments easily?
- Work on docs, explain the two conf file styles, the pros and cons
  of each. Do this in the README.md
- Make examples for the Haddock docs. Use epub-metadata as an
  example for this
- Change project name to tce-config
- More unified naming using *Config everywhere
- Fix tce-config.cabal synopsis and description
